# Project 1
## Build a Portfolio Site 

You can see the hosted project here: 
http://www.daveisadev.com/portfolio/

For this project, I was asked to recreate
a site that was similar to the mockup shown
in the "design-mockup-portfolio.pdf" which is
part of this repository.

I wanted to add a couple of features including:

1. A memu that would highlight different projects based on subject matter.
2. Social links to LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub
3. Some minor animations on the projects when you hover over them.
4. The site is responsive and works on a small, medium, and large screen width 

For my menu, on my initial attempt, I used a simple CSS animation
on the DIV to move the buttons. I would much rather have this be a 
scrolling menu, but I am not sure how to do this yet. The project
will be updated when I achieve this goal.

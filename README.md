# Project 1
## Build a Portfolio Site 

You can see the hosted project here:

For this project, I was asked to recreate
a site that was similar to the mockup shown
in the "design-mockup-portfolio.pdf" which is
part of this repository.

I wanted to add a couple of features including:

1. A menu that highlights different projects based on subject matter.
2. Social links to LinkedIn, Twitter, and GitHub
3. Some minor animations on the projects when you hover over them.
4. The site is responsive and works on a small, medium, and large screen width 

For my menu, on my initial attempt, I used a simple CSS animation
on the DIV to move the buttons. It worked, but it wasn't very clean.
I'll revisit that option once we get further along in the class
and learn some JavaScript techniques and React. For now I made an ellipsis
that you can hover over to switch between the various sections.

For now, most of the links will take you to placeholders, but I will keep improving those as the class progresses.
